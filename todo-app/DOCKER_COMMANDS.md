# Docker Commands for the NestJS Todo App

This file provides a quick reference for the most common Docker commands used to build, run, and manage this application.

**Note for Linux Users:** Depending on your setup, you may need to prefix all `docker` commands with `sudo`.



## Building the Image

To create a Docker image from your app, use:

```bash
docker build -t todo-app .
```

* `-t todo-app` tags the image with a human-readable name.
* `.` specifies the current directory as the build context.

### What if you skip `-t`?

If you run:

```bash
docker build .
```

Docker will still build the image, but:

* It wonâ€™t have a meaningful name.
* You'll need to reference it using its **image ID** (e.g., `docker run <image-id>`), which is harder to manage.

**Always use `-t`** to simplify image management, versioning (`-t todo-app:v1`), and pushing to a registry.


## Running the Container

### Basic Run (Foreground)

This command runs the container in the foreground, which is useful for debugging as logs are printed directly to your terminal.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 todo-app
```
- `-p 3000:3000`: Maps port 3000 on your machine to port 3000 in the container.

### Background Run

This command runs the container in detached mode (in the background) and gives it a specific name for easier management.

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name my-todo-app todo-app
```
- `-d`: Detached mode.
- `--name my-todo-app`: Assigns a custom name to the container.

### Running with Data Persistence (Recommended)

To ensure your `todo.db` data is not lost when the container stops, run it with a named volume.

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v todo-data:/usr/src/app/dist --name my-todo-app todo-app
```
- `-v todo-data:/usr/src/app/dist`: Creates a named volume `todo-data` and mounts it to the `dist` directory inside the container, persisting the database file.



## Managing Containers

### List Running Containers

See all containers that are currently running.

```bash
docker ps
```

To see all containers (including stopped ones), add the `-a` flag:
```bash
docker ps -a
```

### View Container Logs

Follow the logs of a running container. This is essential for debugging.

```bash
docker logs -f my-todo-app
```
- `-f`: Follow the log output.

### Stop a Container

Stops a running container gracefully.

```bash
docker stop my-todo-app
```

### Remove a Container

Deletes a **stopped** container. You cannot remove a running container without forcing it.

```bash
docker rm my-todo-app
```



## Managing Volumes

### List Volumes

See all the Docker volumes on your system.

```bash
docker volume ls
```

### Remove a Volume

Deletes a volume. **Warning: This will permanently delete the data stored in the volume (e.g., your todo database).**

```bash
docker volume rm todo-data
```
