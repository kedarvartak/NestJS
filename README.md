# NestJS Documentation
This repository contains a simple and modular Todo API built using the NestJS framework. It demonstrates how to structure a scalable backend application using controllers, services, DTOs, and modules. The project supports basic CRUD operations for todo items, with proper request validation and error handling. It follows clean architecture principles, separating concerns across layers, and includes unit tests written with Jest to verify the correctness of the core business logic. The project serves as a solid foundation for building RESTful APIs with NestJS, offering clarity, maintainability, and testability.
