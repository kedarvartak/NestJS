# Core Concepts: Setting Up Your First NestJS Project

Now that we have a good understanding of what NestJS is, let's get our hands dirty by setting up a new project.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system (which includes `npm`, the Node Package Manager).

## Installing the NestJS CLI

The easiest way to create a new NestJS project is by using the NestJS Command Line Interface (CLI). It's a powerful tool that helps you create, manage, and build your application.

To install the CLI globally on your system, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

## Creating a New Project

Once the CLI is installed, you can create a new project with a single command. Replace `my-nest-app` with the name you want for your project.

```bash
nest new my-nest-app
```

This command will:
1. Create a new directory called `my-nest-app`.
2. Scaffold a new NestJS project with all the necessary files and dependencies.
3. Install all the required packages from `npm`.

## Running the Application

After the installation is complete, navigate into your new project directory and start the application:

```bash
cd my-nest-app
npm run start:dev
```

This will start the development server. You can now open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a "Hello World!" message.

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first NestJS application. In the next sections, we will explore the different parts of this project.


## Understanding the Project Structure

When you open your new NestJS project, you will see a `src` directory with a few files inside. Let's break down the most important ones:

-   `main.ts`: This is the entry point of your application. It creates a new NestJS application instance and starts the server.
-   `app.module.ts`: This is the root module of your application.
-   `app.controller.ts`: A basic controller with one route.
-   `app.service.ts`: A basic service with a single method.

Now, let's dive into what these concepts mean using a simple analogy: imagine a restaurant.

## Controllers: The Waiter

A **Controller** is like a **waiter** in a restaurant. Its job is to:
1.  **Listen** for a customer's (a user's) request.
2.  **Understand** what the customer wants (e.g., "I want the menu").
3.  **Go to the kitchen** (the Service) to get what the customer asked for.
4.  **Bring the food** (the data/response) back to the customer.

In NestJS, a controller listens for incoming web requests (like when a user visits a URL) and then calls the appropriate service to handle that request.

```typescript
// src/app.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get() // This means: when a user makes a GET request to the main URL...
  getHello(): string {
    return this.appService.getHello(); // ...ask the AppService to get the greeting.
  }
}
```

## Providers (Services): The Chef

A **Provider** (or **Service**) is like the **chef** in the kitchen. Its job is to handle the actual work:
1.  **Receives an order** from the waiter (the Controller).
2.  **Prepares the dish** (fetches data from a database, performs a calculation, etc.).
3.  **Gives the dish** back to the waiter.

The service contains the core logic of your application. This separation keeps your code cleanâ€”the waiter doesn't need to know how to cook, and the chef doesn't need to talk to the customers.

```typescript
// src/app.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!'; // The "dish" being prepared is a simple greeting.
  }
}
```

## Modules: The Restaurant

A **Module** is like the **entire restaurant**. It's a container that groups together related parts of your application:
-   The **waiters** (Controllers).
-   The **chefs** (Providers).

A small restaurant might have just one of each, but a large restaurant could have different sections (a bar, a main dining area, a dessert counter), each with its own waiters and chefs.

In NestJS, a module bundles a set of related features together. For example, a `UsersModule` would contain the `UsersController` and `UsersService`. This keeps your application organized as it grows.

```typescript
// src/app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [AppController], // The waiters in our restaurant
  providers: [AppService],      // The chefs in our restaurant
})
export class AppModule {}
```
By using this structure, NestJS helps you build applications that are organized, easy to understand, and simple to scale.
